# Use Case 4 - Cash Flow Forecasting

## What is Cash Flow Forecasting?

Cash flow forecasting is the process of predicting the future cash inflows and outflows of a business over a certain period. It's essential for ensuring that the company has enough cash on hand to meet its obligations and can plan for future growth. Cash flow forecasts provide insight into whether a company is on track to meet financial goals or needs to adjust spending and investments.

## Why is it Important?

1. **Liquidity Management:** To ensure that the business can cover short-term expenses like payroll, rent, and suppliers.

2. **Decision-Making:** Provides the management with data to make informed decisions about investments, loans, or cost-cutting measures.

3. **Business Planning:** Helps predict future financial health and aids in long-term planning and strategy.

4. **Risk Mitigation:** Alerts the business of potential cash shortages in advance, allowing time to arrange financing or adjust plans.

Banking Business Use Case: Cash Flow Forecasting

## 1. Problem Statement:

Banks face complex liquidity management issues due to the high volume of transactions and the unpredictability of cash inflows and outflows. Inaccurate forecasting can lead to:

* **Liquidity Shortages:** Failure to meet short-term obligations like withdrawals, loans, and repayments.

* **Over-Liquidity:** Holding excess cash without investing it, which impacts profitability.

* **Regulatory Non-compliance:** Central banks require banks to maintain certain liquidity ratios (e.g., **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)**, **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)**) to manage short-term and long-term liquidity risk.

## 2. Business Use Case:

Banks need a cash flow forecasting system that helps predict:

* **Cash Inflows:** Loan disbursements, customer deposits, interbank transfers, bond sales, etc.

* **Cash Outflows:** Withdrawals, loan repayments, operating expenses, interbank transfers, interest payments, etc.

A robust forecasting model helps the bank optimize capital allocation, ensure liquidity compliance, and meet customer demand. It helps answer critical business questions like:

* Will the bank have enough liquidity to meet withdrawal requests during a holiday season?
* Should the bank borrow from the central bank or the market to cover a shortfall?
* Can the bank deploy excess funds into profitable lending or investment opportunities?
